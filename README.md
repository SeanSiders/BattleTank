# Battle Tank
An Unreal Engine 4 (C++) game initially developed along an [online course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) by [GameDev.tv](http://gamedev.tv). This is a bit of sandbox for me to explore game development techniques in C++ that are specific to Tank Battle style games. *(ex. World of Tanks)*
